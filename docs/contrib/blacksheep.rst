Kleinmann-ORM BlackSheep integration
===================================

We have a lightweight integration util ``kleinmann.contrib.blacksheep`` which has a single function ``register_kleinmann`` which sets up Kleinmann-ORM on startup and cleans up on teardown.

BlackSheep is an asynchronous web framework to build event based web applications with Python.


See the :ref:`example_blacksheep` & have a look at the :ref:`contrib_pydantic` tutorials.
