Kleinmann-ORM FastAPI integration
================================

We have a lightweight integration util ``kleinmann.contrib.fastapi`` which has a class ``RegisterKleinmann`` that can be used to set/clean up Kleinmann-ORM in lifespan context.

FastAPI is basically Starlette & Pydantic, but in a very specific way.


See the :ref:`example_fastapi` & have a look at the :ref:`contrib_pydantic` tutorials.
